# Famous ~~Captains~~ Entities - none alike!

::: info :neofox_floof_mug: MMMH, REAL CODE
This **RUNS**! *Playful premises aside*, this is a functioning showcase of **fenn**ecs principles.

Get comfy, grab a cup of ~~Java~~ ~~CoffeeScript~~ ~~Visual J#~~ whatever, and get your paws dirty playing around in the code! It's good fun!

All `.csproj` and `.cs` files are [over here on Github!](https://github.com/outfox/fennecs/blob/main/cookbook)

### Premise
Let's reminisce some famous Captains of old and new.

This example will explore what Entities "look" like in your logs or `DebuggerDisplay`, and what happens when they Despawn, and how they get recycled.

[Entity](/docs/Entities/index.md)'s `ToString()` method lets us take a quick peek where no human has gone before.

We spawn a unique [Entity](/docs/Entities/index.md) for each captain; but `kirk` gets despawned and replaced by The Next Generation (`picard`). Then we create a bunch more and output to visualize how recycled Entities compare to each other and to give a feeling over how a [World](/docs/World.md) counts Generations up when Entities are destroyed.
