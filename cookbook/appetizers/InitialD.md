# Revving up a Sleeper

::: info :neofox_floof_mug: MMMH, REAL CODE
This **RUNS**! *Playful premises aside*, this is a functioning showcase of **fenn**ecs principles.

Get comfy, grab a cup of ~~Java~~ ~~CoffeeScript~~ ~~Visual J#~~ whatever, and get your paws dirty playing around in the code! It's good fun!

All `.csproj` and `.cs` files are [over here on Github!](https://github.com/outfox/fennecs/blob/main/cookbook) 

:::

### Premise
Let's build a sleeper drift racing championship car out of nothing but Entities and Components! A smooth ride into to **fenn**ecs where you won't spill your tofu yet!
